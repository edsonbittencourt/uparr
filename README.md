A repo set up to store the file structure and config files I use for *arr and related applications setup, some public/private trackers references and a little about selfhosting.

Recently changed some key components in the infrastructure setup, so I'll be using this repo as my personal guide for new rollouts/updates.

The apps I'm currently using are:

- [Dashy](https://github.com/Lissy93/dashy): A stylish and configurable dashboard to organize links.
- [Dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge): A lightweight Docker management UI.
- [Sonarr](https://github.com/Sonarr/Sonarr): Automates TV show downloads and organization.
- [Radarr](https://github.com/Radarr/Radarr): Movie downloading and management tool.
- [Prowlarr](https://github.com/Prowlarr/Prowlarr): Indexer management for Usenet and torrents.
- [Bazarr](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr): Manages and downloads subtitles for your media.
- [Qbittorrent](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent): A powerful and easy-to-use BitTorrent client.
- [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin): An open-source media system for your own library.
- [Miniflux](https://github.com/miniflux/v2): A minimalist and open-source RSS reader.
- [NGINX Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/): A simple way to manage your NGINX proxy.

Another resources:

- A few others that I'll be adding over time.

It's important to know that this repository is NOT intended to serve as a guide for anyone, because the process of putting information here will be slow and you have options that are a thousand times better, more detailed, and more well-structured in other repositories to consult.
